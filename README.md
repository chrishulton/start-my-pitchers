Do you play Yahoo Fantasy Baseball?

Are you tired of swapping pitcher positions every day, every week, for the entire 24 week season?

[Start My Pitchers](http://startmypitchers.herokuapp.com/) takes care of this tedious, annoying process with the click of a button.

Auth your Yahoo account and start reclaiming those wasted minutes.  One click a week is all it takes.

### What's next?

How about one click, period, for the entire season?

Automatic, recurring lineup setting is the next big feature in the works.
